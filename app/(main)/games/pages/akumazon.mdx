Hi fun peoples, this is our first time joining a ludum dare event. Our game dev doesn’t know how to use Unity, our game art doesn’t know how to draw, and our design guy is a big dull dud. 😤😤 This seems like a disaster, but anyway, wish us luck =3 🤣

Welcome to AkuMAZON,
a quirky story puzzle game where you own a mysterious demon shop and summon different little demons to meet your client’s need. Remember: pay close attention to the villager’s stories, read the guide notes and spellbooks carefully, and always make right decisions. Sometimes it’s hard to be right, huh?

Hint: you’ll think this village is peaceful, but it’s really NOT.
Another hint: pick your poison and save the villagers!
