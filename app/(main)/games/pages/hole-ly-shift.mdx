This is my first try on LDjam and is soloing!!!

solo is sooooo exciting (and HARD)

made it anyway, hope you enjoy my very tiny game!(it’s not even finished…

So the gameplay is, watch cute little things bouncing, I guess.

Control: Mouse

Mostly made by myself, except:

SFX made using ChipTone

outline shader in Godot asset-library/asset/2829
